	<h1>Thank you!</h1>
	<p>Thank you for using my extension. It's been fun designing this as an underground project and seeing it grow to such a large user base. As you know, the new MyNEU portal has launched and this extension is not compatible with it. Nevertheless, I have added the option to re-enable the extension should you come across another terribly designed Northeastern page.</p>
	<p>I will work hard to push out a new update as soon as I can, but Northeastern has been unhelpful in this process, preventing me from assisting with or even trying out the new portal until the release date. I cannot promise that a new version will come by the end of this Fall semester, but I will be working as hard as I can to get an update out in a timely manner.</p>
	<p>This time around, I will be looking to integrate better and more advanced features in collaboration with the many students of Northeastern who have built wonderful tools like <a href="https://searchneu.com/">SearchNEU</a> and <a href="https://coursepro.io/">CoursePro</a>.</p>
